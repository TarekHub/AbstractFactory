# AbstractFactory
The purpose of the Abstract Factory pattern is to create objects grouped into families without having to know the concrete classes 
for creating these objects.
  *The pater is used in the following cases:
1/ A system using products needs to be independent of how these products are created and bundled together.
2/ A system is parameterized by several product families that can evolve.
